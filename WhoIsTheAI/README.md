# ðŸ¤– Who is the AI?

A multiplayer social deduction game where players try to identify who among them is secretly an AI. The AI is powered by OpenAI's GPT API and is designed to mimic real human responses, making the game both challenging and fun.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Rules

1. Each game has 2â€“7 real players and one hidden AI.
2. All players answer the same question in each round.
3. After answers are shown, players vote to eliminate the AI.
4. The player with the most votes is removed.
5. The game continues until the AI is eliminated â€” or the AI wins by outlasting the humans.
6. No spamming or disrespectful language â€” fair play is expected.

> Rules are displayed in a clear, numbered list inside a scrollable container to ensure readability on all devices.

- Behaviors are intentionally varied in accuracy and tone.
- AI answers mimic lazy or vague human replies to make detection harder.
